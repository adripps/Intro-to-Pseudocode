Short Answer:
1. Programmers use pseudocode to express a desired algorithm without writing it in any particular language's syntax.
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer nothing will happen because it's does not use the proper syntax for the computer to understand.
Programming Assignment:
1.  INPUT a number
    INPUT a second number
    IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
      PRINT number one
    IF the first number is less than the second number THEN
      PRINT number two
    ELSE
      PRINT "Numbers are equal"
2.  INIT number to 1
    WHILE number is less than or equal to 100
      PRINT number
      INCREMENT number
    ENDWHILE
3.  INPUT searched for phonebook entry
    INPUT phonebook entries
    FOR each phonebook entry
      IF searched for phonebook entry is equal to phonebook entry
        RETURN phonebook entry
4.  const phoneBookEntry = '555-5555';
    const phoneBook = ['555-111', '555-3333', '555-5555'];

    function findEntry (phoneBook, phoneBookEntry) {
      for (var i = 0; i < phoneBook.length; i++){
        if(phoneBook[i] === phoneBookEntry){
          return phoneBook[i];
        }
      }
    }
